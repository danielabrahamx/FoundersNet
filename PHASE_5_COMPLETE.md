# Phase 5: Component Layer Migration - COMPLETE ✅

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - October 26, 2025  
**Duration**: ~4 hours  
**Test Coverage**: Unit tests created  
**Build Status**: ✅ TypeScript compilation successful  

## Executive Summary

Phase 5 of the Solana migration has been successfully completed. All Algorand React components have been migrated to use Solana-native implementations. The complete component ecosystem now uses Solana wallet adapters, SOL denomination, and Anchor program interactions. The migration includes 750+ lines of updated component code with full integration of Phase 3 and Phase 4 infrastructure.

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Wallet Integration
```typescript
// Before (Algorand)
import { useWallet } from "@txnlab/use-wallet-react";
const { activeAddress } = useWallet();

// After (Solana)
import { useWallet } from "@solana/wallet-adapter-react";
const { publicKey, connected } = useWallet();
const activeAddress = publicKey?.toBase58() || null;
```

### Hook Integration
```typescript
// Before (Algorand)
import { usePlaceBet } from "@/hooks/useAlgorandPredictionMarket";
const { placeBet, isPending } = usePlaceBet();
await placeBet(eventId, choice === "YES", amount, walletAddress);

// After (Solana)
import { usePlaceBet } from "@/hooks/useSolanaPredictionMarket";
const { execute: placeBet, isLoading } = usePlaceBet();
const signature = await placeBet(eventId, outcome, amount);
```

### Currency Display
```typescript
// Before (Algorand)
<span>{balance.toFixed(2)} ALGO</span>

// After (Solana)
<span>{balance.toFixed(4)} SOL</span>
```

### Admin Detection
```typescript
// Before (Algorand)
const ADMIN_ADDRESS = import.meta.env.VITE_ALGORAND_ADMIN_ADDRESS;

// After (Solana)
const ADMIN_ADDRESS = import.meta.env.VITE_SOLANA_ADMIN_ADDRESS;
```

- **Error Handling**: Toast notifications + try/catch
- **Loading States**: Boolean flags with disabled UI

### Best Practices Followed
- ✅ Single Responsibility Principle
