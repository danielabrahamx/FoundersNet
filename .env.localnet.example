# LOCALNET CONFIGURATION
# ===================================
# This file configures the app for LOCAL DEVELOPMENT
# using AlgoKit LocalNet (Docker-based private blockchain)
#
# Quick Start:
# 1. Start Docker Desktop
# 2. Run: algokit localnet start
# 3. Run: npm run deploy:local
# 4. Run: npm run dev
# ===================================

# Algorand Network Configuration
VITE_ALGORAND_NETWORK=localnet

# App ID (will be set after deployment)
# First deployment is usually app ID 1
VITE_ALGORAND_APP_ID=1

# Admin address (deployer account)
# This will be auto-generated when you run deploy:local
VITE_ALGORAND_ADMIN_ADDRESS=

# LocalNet Algorand Node

ALGORAND_LOCALNET_TOKEN=aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

# LocalNet Indexer

# LocalNet KMD (Key Management Daemon)

# LocalNet Dispenser Account (pre-funded account for testing)
# This account has billions of microALGOs for funding test accounts
# Mnemonic is public knowledge - ONLY for LocalNet use

# Database (optional for local dev - uses in-memory by default)
# DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/startup_markets_local

# WalletConnect (not needed for LocalNet - uses programmatic signing)

# Development Settings

VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000

# ===================================
# NOTES FOR LOCALNET DEVELOPMENT
# ===================================
#
# 1. NO WALLET APP REQUIRED
#    LocalNet uses programmatic account management via KMD
#    Accounts are created and funded in code
#
# 2. UNLIMITED FUNDING
#    Use the dispenser account to fund any test account
#    No faucet limits or delays
#
# 3. INSTANT RESET
#    Run: algokit localnet reset
#    Wipes all blockchain state and starts fresh
#
# 4. FIRST APP ID IS ALWAYS 1
#    On a fresh LocalNet, your first deployed app gets ID 1
#
# 5. PRIVATE NETWORK
#    LocalNet is isolated - transactions don't touch TestNet/MainNet
#    Perfect for testing without any real-world consequences
