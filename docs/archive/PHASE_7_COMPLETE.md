## 🚀 Devnet Deployment

### Prerequisites

1. **Solana CLI** (installed)
   ```bash
   solana --version
   ```

2. **Anchor Framework** (installed)
   ```bash
   anchor --version
   ```

3. **Node.js 18+** (installed)
   ```bash
   node --version
   ```

   - Get from: https://faucet.solana.com
   - Or: `solana airdrop 2 --url devnet`

### Deployment Steps

#### Step 1: Configure Environment

```bash
# Copy template to devnet config
cp .env.solana.devnet.example .env.solana.devnet

# Update with your wallet keypair (if needed)
# Default: ~/.config/solana/id.json
```

Key variables in `.env.solana.devnet`:
```bash
VITE_SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://api.devnet.solana.com
VITE_SOLANA_WS_URL=wss://api.devnet.solana.com
VITE_SOLANA_PROGRAM_ID=Fg6PaFpoGXkYsidMpWTK6W2BeZ7FEfcYkg476zPFsLnS

```bash
npm run compile:solana
```

Expected output:
```
✅ BPF package generated successfully: target/deploy/prediction_market.so
```

#### Step 3: Deploy to Devnet
