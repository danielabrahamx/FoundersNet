# Phase 2 Completion Report: Smart Contract Migration (Rust/Anchor)

**Date Completed**: October 26, 2025  
**Phase**: Phase 2 - Smart Contract Migration from Algorand to Solana  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully completed the full migration of the Prediction Market smart contract from Algorand (Python) to Solana (Rust/Anchor). All core functionality has been ported with feature parity, comprehensive error handling, and full test coverage.

---

## Phase 2.1: Initialize Anchor Program ✅

### Completed Tasks
- ✅ Verified `Anchor.toml` configuration
- ✅ Confirmed `Cargo.toml` dependencies (anchor-lang 0.30.1)
- ✅ Set up initial `lib.rs` structure
- ✅ Configured program ID: `Fg6PaFpoGXkYsidMpWTK6W2BeZ7FEfcYkg476zPFsLnS`
- ✅ Configured networks (localnet, devnet, testnet)

### Key Files
- `Anchor.toml` - Network configurations
- `Cargo.toml` - Rust dependencies
- `lib.rs` - Main program entry point

---

## Phase 2.2: Define Data Structures ✅

### Account Structures Implemented

#### 1. ProgramState
```rust
#[account]
#[derive(InitSpace)]
pub struct ProgramState {
    pub admin: Pubkey,           // Admin address
    pub event_counter: u64,      // Total events created
    pub bet_counter: u64,        // Total bets placed
    pub bump: u8,                // PDA bump seed
}
```
- **PDA Seeds**: `["program_state"]`
- **Purpose**: Global program state management

#### 2. Event
```rust
#[account]
#[derive(InitSpace)]
pub struct Event {
    pub event_id: u64,
    #[max_len(200)]
    pub name: String,
    pub end_time: i64,
    pub resolved: bool,
    pub outcome: bool,           // true=YES, false=NO
    pub total_yes_bets: u64,
    pub total_no_bets: u64,
    pub total_yes_amount: u64,
    pub total_no_amount: u64,
    pub creator: Pubkey,
    pub bump: u8,
}
```
- **PDA Seeds**: `["event", event_id]`
- **Migration**: Ported from Algorand `EventStruct`

#### 3. Bet
```rust
#[account]
#[derive(InitSpace)]
pub struct Bet {
    pub bet_id: u64,
    pub event_id: u64,
    pub bettor: Pubkey,
    pub outcome: bool,           // true=YES, false=NO
    pub amount: u64,
    pub claimed: bool,
    pub bump: u8,
}
```
- **PDA Seeds**: `["bet", bet_id]`
- **Migration**: Ported from Algorand `BetStruct`

#### 4. Event Escrow
- **PDA Seeds**: `["escrow", event_id]`
- **Purpose**: Holds all bet funds for an event
- **Type**: `AccountInfo` (uninitialized PDA)

### PDA Architecture
All accounts use Program Derived Addresses (PDAs) for deterministic, secure address generation:
- Eliminates need for client-side address tracking
- Ensures unique addresses per entity
- Provides built-in authorization via seeds

---

## Phase 2.3: Implement Core Business Logic ✅

### Instructions Implemented

#### 1. Initialize
```rust
pub fn initialize(ctx: Context<Initialize>, admin: Pubkey) -> Result<()>
```
- Creates program state account
- Sets admin address
- Initializes counters to 0

#### 2. Create Event
```rust
pub fn create_event(ctx: Context<CreateEvent>, name: String, end_time: i64) -> Result<()>
```
- **Admin only**
- Validates `end_time` is in the future
- Increments `event_counter`
- Creates Event PDA with auto-incremented ID
- Initializes escrow PDA

**Validations:**
- ✅ Caller must be admin
- ✅ End time must be future timestamp

#### 3. Place Bet
```rust
pub fn place_bet(ctx: Context<PlaceBet>, event_id: u64, outcome: bool, amount: u64) -> Result<()>
```
- **Public access**
- Transfers SOL to event escrow
- Updates event bet totals
- Creates Bet PDA with auto-incremented ID

**Validations:**
- ✅ Event must exist
- ✅ Event must not be resolved
- ✅ Current time < end_time
- ✅ Amount > 0

#### 4. Resolve Event
```rust
pub fn resolve_event(ctx: Context<ResolveEvent>, event_id: u64, outcome: bool) -> Result<()>
```
- **Admin only**
- Marks event as resolved
- Sets final outcome (YES/NO)
- Enables winners to claim

**Validations:**
- ✅ Caller must be admin
- ✅ Event must not be already resolved

#### 5. Claim Winnings
```rust
pub fn claim_winnings(ctx: Context<ClaimWinnings>, event_id: u64, bet_id: u64) -> Result<()>
```
- **Bet owner only**
- Calculates proportional payout
- Transfers winnings from escrow
- Marks bet as claimed

**Payout Formula:**
```
payout = (bet_amount × total_pool) ÷ winning_pool
```

**Validations:**
- ✅ Event must be resolved
- ✅ Bet not already claimed
- ✅ Caller is bettor
- ✅ Bet outcome matches event outcome

#### 6. Emergency Withdraw
```rust
pub fn emergency_withdraw(ctx: Context<EmergencyWithdraw>, event_id: u64) -> Result<()>
```
- **Admin only**
- Drains event escrow to admin
- For emergency situations

---

## Phase 2.4: Implement Query Functions ✅

### View Functions

While Solana doesn't have native "view" functions like Algorand, all data is queryable via account fetching:

```typescript
// Get program state
const state = await program.account.programState.fetch(programStatePDA);

// Get event by ID
const event = await program.account.event.fetch(eventPDA);

// Get bet by ID
const bet = await program.account.bet.fetch(betPDA);

// Get all events (via getProgramAccounts)
const events = await program.account.event.all();

// Get user bets (via getProgramAccounts with filter)
const userBets = await program.account.bet.all([
  {
    memcmp: {
      offset: 8 + 8 + 8, // Skip discriminator + bet_id + event_id
      bytes: bettor.toBase58(),
    }
  }
]);
```

### Query Capabilities
- ✅ Get all events
- ✅ Get specific event by ID
- ✅ Get all bets
- ✅ Get bets by user (filtered)
- ✅ Get bets by event (filtered)
- ✅ Get program state (counters, admin)
- ✅ Get escrow balance

---

## Phase 2.5: Add Error Handling & Tests ✅

### Custom Error Types

```rust
#[error_code]
pub enum ErrorCode {
    #[msg("Only admin can perform this action")]
    Unauthorized,
    
    #[msg("Event has already been resolved")]
    EventAlreadyResolved,
    
    #[msg("Event has not been resolved yet")]
    EventNotResolved,
    
    #[msg("Winnings have already been claimed")]
    AlreadyClaimed,
    
    #[msg("This bet is on the losing outcome")]
    LosingBet,
    
    #[msg("Event does not exist")]
    EventDoesNotExist,
    
    #[msg("Betting period has ended")]
    BettingPeriodEnded,
    
    #[msg("Bet amount must be greater than zero")]
    BetAmountMustBeGreaterThanZero,
    
    #[msg("End time must be in the future")]
    EndTimeMustBeInFuture,
    
    #[msg("No balance to withdraw")]
    NoBalanceToWithdraw,
}
```

### Test Suite (`tests/prediction-market.ts`)

#### Tests Implemented (10 total)

1. ✅ **Initialize Program**
   - Creates program state

   - Verifies opposite outcome works

5. ✅ **Resolve Event**
   - Admin resolves with YES outcome
   - Verifies resolution status

6. ✅ **Claim Winnings**
   - Winner claims payout
   - Verifies balance increase
   - Marks bet as claimed

7. ✅ **Prevent Non-Admin Event Creation**
   - Non-admin attempts create
   - Expects `Unauthorized` error

8. ✅ **Prevent Betting on Resolved Event**
   - Attempt bet after resolution
   - Expects `EventAlreadyResolved` error

9. ✅ **Prevent Double Claiming**
   - Attempt second claim
   - Expects `AlreadyClaimed` error

10. ✅ **Edge Cases**

   - **Impact**: More granular, better isolation

2. **Transaction Model**
   - **Algorand**: Atomic transaction groups required
   - **Solana**: Single transactions with multiple accounts
   - **Impact**: Simpler client integration

3. **Account References**
   - **Algorand**: Box references passed explicitly
   - **Solana**: PDAs derived deterministically
   - **Impact**: No need to track addresses client-side

4. **Fee Handling**
   - **Algorand**: Fee pooling in transaction groups
   - **Solana**: Per-transaction fees
   - **Impact**: Different cost structure
